subtitle: "Strategic Data for Your Business"

description: "\"Data is the gold of the 21st century\". Although this is of course true, it is not so
easy to generate real added value from data - because only reliable data sources, the
right analysis and the right insights can be gold-plated. I can help you build an
end-to-end data strategy that is in line with your business goals.
<br><br>
As a CTO/co-founder and experienced data scientist, I combine the
perspectives that urgently need to be brought together here: Business goals, data
architecture and analytics. With my guidance, we’ll take your business to the next
level."

approach_title_1: "Initial Research"
approach_body_1: "<h4> Business Goals & Vision</h4>
<p>
    What are the company's business goals, strategic goals and how can data help to achieve them? To
    what extent are the right insights still missing?</p>
<h4>Data Landscape Assessment</h4>
<p>
    What data is available and how is it stored at the moment? What is the quality of the data and
    what
    is currently being done with it? Which underlying systems (cloud, databases) are involved?</p>
<h4>Gap analysis</h4>
<p>Bring your business goals and the current data landscape together: which strategic goals and
    needs
    are already mapped by the current data landscape, and which are not? How good is the current
    data
    basis in terms of quality? What’s the status of reporting and analytics? What other data do we
    need?</p>
<h4>Identify further data sources</h4>
<p>What data sources are not used yet and how can your business collect the missing dots? What is
    needed to change in order to collect and store more data fields?</p>"

approach_title_2: "Building Stage"
approach_body_2: "<h4>Develop data architecture</h4>
<p>The data sources have been identified and now a data architecture needs to be created. Depending
    on
    the initial situation, this either fits into the existing systems or is set up as a new system.
    The
    concept takes into account the existing systems, the standards for data security and, of course,
    the
    business objectives for which the data will subsequently be used.</p>
<h4>Analytics and reporting</h4>
<p>The data is available in the desired quality and can now be used. The next step is to develop
    the
    analyses to get the insights the business needs. This ranges from a business intelligence
    solution
    for users to the setup of a machine learning system - depending on the desired analytics
    solution.</p>
<h4>Possibly: A/B testing</h4>
<p>Left or right? Sometimes you have to try out two paths to find out which one leads to the goal.
    I
    would be happy to set up an A/B test for your specific questions in order to make a data-driven
    decision. As an ex-scientist, I can guide you through the correct initial question and through
    the
    evaluation of the results.</p>"

approach_title_3: "Consolidate"
approach_body_3: "<h4>Foster a Data-driven culture</h4>
Simply setting up systems, usable data and great dashboards is just the beginning. Now the
data-driven culture must be lived. To do this, we take another look at the business objectives
and
analytics. Are there low-hanging fruits from which we can immediately derive insights? What is
the
timeline and underlying KPI’s for all further insights? And above all: how do you train a team
to be
data-driven?
