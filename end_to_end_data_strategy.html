                    <p>Data is the gold of the 21st century". Although this is of course true, it is not so
                        easy to generate real added value from data - because only reliable data sources, the
                        right analysis and the right insights can be gold-plated. I can help you build an
                        end-to-end data strategy that is in line with your business goals. </p>

                    1. Business Goals & Vision
                    What are the company's business goals, strategic goals and how can data help to achieve them? To
                    what extent are the right insights still missing?
                    2. Data Landscape Assessment
                    What data is available and how is it stored at the moment? What is the quality of the data and what
                    is currently being done with it? Which underlying systems (cloud, databases) are involved?
                    3. Gap analysis
                    Bring your business goals and the current data landscape together: which strategic goals and needs
                    are already mapped by the current data landscape, and which are not? How good is the current data
                    basis in terms of quality? What’s the status of reporting and analytics? What other data do we need?
                    4. Identify further data sources
                    What data sources are not used yet and how can your business collect the missing dots? What is
                    needed to change in order to collect and store more data fields?
                    5. Data integration and architecture
                    The data sources have been identified and now a data architecture needs to be created. Depending on
                    the initial situation, this either fits into the existing systems or is set up as a new system. The
                    concept takes into account the existing systems, the standards for data security and, of course, the
                    business objectives for which the data will subsequently be used
                    6. Analytics and reporting
                    The data is available in the desired quality and can now be used. The next step is to develop the
                    analyses to get the insights the business needs. This ranges from a business intelligence solution
                    for users to the setup of a machine learning system - depending on the desired analytics solution
                    7. Data-driven culture
                    Simply setting up systems, usable data and great dashboards is just the beginning. Now the
                    data-driven culture must be lived. To do this, we take another look at the business objectives and
                    analytics. Are there low-hanging fruits from which we can immediately derive insights? What is the
                    timeline and underlying KPI’s for all further insights? And above all: how do you train a team to be
                    data-driven?
                    8. A/B testing
                    Left or right? Sometimes you have to try out two paths to find out which one leads to the goal. I
                    would be happy to set up an A/B test for your specific questions in order to make a data-driven
                    decision. As an ex-scientist, I can guide you through the correct initial question and through the
                    evaluation of the results.
