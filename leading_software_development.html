title: "Leading software development"
subtitle: "Give your tech team direction"

description: "Assembling the right team is crucial. But where to begin? Consider your product, preferred tech stack,
business objectives, and budget to determine the optimal hiring strategy and future team expansion plans.

Now, assuming you have a tech team ready to kick off development, leading such a team isn't as simple as it may seem.
While numerous frameworks exist for effective software development management, agile methods often prove most
successful. With extensive experience in team building and leadership, coupled with Scrum certification, I offer the
expertise needed to guide your team through the development process seamlessly.
<br><br>
For those lacking technical expertise, navigating the intricacies of a tech team can be daunting. In software
development, many aspects, like CI/CD pipelines, may not directly impact end-users but significantly influence code
organization and development efficiency. Drawing from my experience as a CTO/co-founder, I've honed the ability to
prioritize tasks, distinguishing between technical refinements—such as code refactoring—and the timely release of new
features. Ultimately, code serves as a tool to drive business objectives, a principle I am committed to upholding."
