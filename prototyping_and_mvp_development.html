title: "Get your product to market faster"
subtitle: "Prototyping and MVP development"

description: "
Developing a completed product without validating its viability can be a costly mistake. The development of a minimal
viable product (MVP) allows for an iterative approach to product development. By quickly creating and testing
an MVP, we can gather feedback from users early in the process, enabling us to refine and improve the
product continuously.
<br><br>
Whether you need a prototype to convince investors or an to go to market with, developing it fast and efficiently is the
goal. As a CTO/co-founder, I've made and led the development of many prototypes and MVPs.
My experience in software development and Agile methodologies allows me to lead rapid
prototyping and MVP development cycles, ensuring that your company remains agile and responsive to market demands.

benefit_body_3: "When you're starting an early stage company, you need to convince investors that your idea is worth
their money. Having a prototype to show what you want to make can help you get your point across and get the funding
your company needs."

approach_title_1: "understand the product"
approach_body_1: "<h4>Mockups, descriptions and user stories</h4>
<p>In order to know how to build your prototype or MVP, I need to understand what you want to build.
    Maybe you already have some mockups or a detailed description of your product through user stories. If not, I can
    help
    you gather your ideas through workshops and interviews with stakeholders in order to write user stories, which are
    concise, simple
    descriptions of features or functionalities from the perspective of an end user. This way, we can make sure we're
    building the
    right thing from the start.</p>

approach_title_2: "leading prototype development"
approach_body_2: "<h4>Agile development</h4>
<p>Maybe your team is already used to working in an agile process.
    If so, great! If not, we have to set it up. In Agile development, we work in short iterations,
    called sprints, where we develop a small part of the product. After each sprint, we evaluate what we've built
    and decide what to do next. This way, not only do we make the most important parts first, but we also make sure
    we're building the right thing.
</p>"

approach_title_3: "testing the MVP in the market"
approach_body_3: "<h4>Going live</h4>
<p>Once the MVP is built, we can go live. In agile development, testing the product in the market, collecting feedback
    and adapting quickly
    is the name of the game.
    By testing ideas early and often, we can identify and mitigate risks before they escalate. Prototyping
    and MVP development allow us to validate assumptions, assess technical feasibility, and identify potential
    roadblocks
    early in the development process. </p>"
